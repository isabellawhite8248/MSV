MSV = Music Simulator Virtual
README
--------

movements folder - stores the animation movements you can use
seperate class for the depixelator?
images folder - - holds the files with information in format color code - > dots, time stamps and image files (stencils)
key controls to manipulate draw image: (does this by altering frame dimensions the image is set in)

W - increase height
D - increase width
Z = decrease height
A - decrease width

REPL! In the animation class time stamp - figlet drawing diagram with time stamps labeled
prompts with the first time stamp and after you type the command then after the last one it states okay
ready to animate and the proper button functionalities are implemented (MAYBE HAVE A STATUS WITH RECORDING + READY TO ANIMATE)

red ellipse - signals recording
label - status - if animations are programed in via the repl

commands - either an animation for the time stamp or back -- switch to latter time stamp
first message - REPL ACTIVATED -- user types animate -- if valid -- meaning there is A FILE A FIGLET WITH THE
TIMELINE IS PRINTED, WILL GO OFF OF THE SELECTED FiLE RADIO BUTTON IN THE DRAW CLASS WHICH WILL BE STORED IN THE IMAGES FOLDER
forwards -- switches to the time stamp in front if null print invalid command try again
set - makes it ready for animation, if there are any unfilled time stamp gaps then need to
fill in with a random animation - making one animation the default maybe floating around + bouncing off the walls
would be cool to make the object wrap the screen in translation but I don't know


todo
REPL - program the repl in the animation class + figlet child class
- label connected to the repl to show animation status
- if playing have a red ellipse in the top of the pane and disable the repl until the timeline completes
then start it again with the corresponding prompt
DOWNSIDE -- will have to toggle between animation screen and the repl but whatever -- at least the program doesn't need to quit for that

depixletar
animations - movements - rotate, rassemble, random float, jump (with the beat) float

file saver - have an animations file folder and add functionality to write to the folder and reload in past animations labeled by song names
should have the same name as the file but with anime after it and should store the list of animations by time block

read up on Tarun's slack message topics and touch base with Siege

start over

no longer using the REPL class, breaks the program, going to have a seperate button called program which
adds timeline grid to the pane and press buttons to program then press done to switch back out of it


potential update -- for speed have a slider instead of three choices slow, medium and fast -- but for now it is fine I guess

can program more movements these are just ones that I can start with then for each individual one we will need to figure out what animation you want -- ex -- > for free falling may want the transition of the feathers to be falling from side to side or whatever

as a transition could make a move where one dot gets bigger and bigger and becomes the entire background?? coolio then start w

translate along a path?? ooof

BUG
1. whenever you select a file to load to the animation that is the file which is loaded no matter which toggle button you press later
2. also there is a blank toggle button in the group  - I am pretty sure this is due to a new line symbol in the drawfiles names list file but I am not sure
3. Also whenever you are forming dot groups for the draw -- it will make a dot group out of white as a default whether you selected or drew with
that color or not just because that is the default hue of the color picker.
